### Reviewer Guidance

- [ ] The vision for TDM-AutoMasklet is "git clone f5". In an ideal world, it should be possible to run the script, without any parameters, and to deliver a minimal viable shrink-wrapped PoC. The bar for any PR is that it should contribute toward this goal, more than it detracts from it.
- [ ] Does the code have appropriate comments? Is it easy to read and understand?
- [ ] If the code adds new functionality, is that functionality documented appropriately?
- [ ] Do the GitHub Actions run successfully?
- [ ] Has the code been tested?
- [ ] Does this code practice the ["boy scout rule"](https://deviq.com/principles/boy-scout-rule). Is it left cleaner than it was found?

If the answer to any of these is no, it is your duty to reject the PR, in order to keep the code clean.
