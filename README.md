# TDM-AutoMasklet
A Test Data Manager subsetting and anonymization worked example.

You can read more about this project in [a blog post by Steve Jones, available here](https://voiceofthedba.com/2024/07/10/up-and-running-quickly-with-test-data-manager/), and you can watch a 10 minute video about it here:

## Purpose
This project exists as a minimal viable proof of concept for the subsetter and anonymize CLIs that come with Redgate Test Data Manager.

The run-auto-masklet.ps1 powershell script walks you through the steps required to subset and mask the PII in a sample database.

The ojective is to give users an easy way to get started with the CLIs, and to understand their usage.

## System set up
You will need:
- A Windows machine to run this script and the subsetter/anonymize CLIs on. (May also work on Linux, but not tested.)
- A SQL Server instance to build some sample databases on.
- If these files are downloaded as a zip file, the [PowerShell Execution Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4) must be set to ByPass, or Unrestricted. If these files are cloned into a git repository, the PowerShell Execution Policy must be set to ByPass, Unrestricted, or RemoteSigned. (RemoteSigned is the default on Windows Servers). To manage your execution policy run the following PowerShell commands:

```
# To determine your execution policy:
Get-ExecutionPolicy

# To change your execution policy for a single session:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process

# To permanently change your execution policy (must be executed as admin):
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

## Instructions
1. Get the code either by cloning the repo (prefered), or by downloding and extracting the zip file (if it is not practical to use git to clone the repo):
    1. **To clone the repo:** Ensure ([git is installed](https://git-scm.com/)). Then open a PowerShell command prompt and run the following command: 
```
git clone https://github.com/alex-yates-redgate/TDM-AutoMasklet.git
```
    2. **To download the code as a zip file:** Click the green "<> Code" button above, and select "Download ZIP". Then extract the zip file as you see fit. Finally, review the note under System Setup (above) about PowerShell Execution Policies, and ensure the PowerShell Execution Policy on your machine is appropriately configured.
2. Review the file .\run-auto-masklet.ps1. In particular, pay attention to the "param" (parameters) section at the top. This section assumes your SQL Instance is running on localhost, and that you would like to output your files to C:/temp/auto-masklet. (This directory will be cleaned and recreated each time you run the script). If you would like to use a different SQL Instance or output directory, update the config as appropriate.
3. Navigate to the directory you copied the code to, and then run the script in a PowerShell window. The script will download, configure, and start a new trial for the TDM CLIs. Note, during licence/trial activation, a web browser may open, and you may be required to log into the Redgate licencing portal.
```
cd TDM-AutoMasklet      # Navigate to the directory you cloned the repo to/extracted the zip file to
.\run-auto-masklet.ps1  # Run the script
```
4. The script will create a couple of sample databases for you (by default, Northwind_FullRestore and Northwind_Subset). If these databases already exist, they will be dropped and recreated. The script will then pause and walk you through each of the major steps requiredd to subset and anonymize a database. Follow the instructions, and pay particular attention to each of the "Observe" and "Next" blocks, before continuing to the next stage.

_Notes about the script:_
- _If you do not have dbatools or anonymize/subsetter installed already, you will need to execute run-auto-masklet.ps1 as admin (the first time) to perform the download/install._
- _When downloading and installing new software (initial runs and following software updates), the script will need a few minutes at the start to download and install everything. Subsequent runs will be much, much faster!_

## Next steps
After completing this worked example, I encourage you to review the following technical resources:
- Documentation:  https://documentation.red-gate.com/testdatamanager/command-line-interface-cli
- Training:       https://www.red-gate.com/hub/university/courses/test-data-management/cloning/overview/introduction-to-tdm

Can you subset and mask one of your own databases?

## Work to do:
- Move this to an official Redgate repository.
